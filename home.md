I am currently a Data Scientist at [Bayer CropSciences](https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/){:target="_blank"},
where I help with data and analytic on the fontier of IoT in glass-house technology.  I also design data products that fits the automated decision making pipeline.

In 2018 I joined a group of transdiciplinary scientists at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/){:target="_blank"},

which led into collaboration with a bigger network of artists and scientists at [SEADS](https://seads.network/){:target="_blank"},

In general I'm interested in post 1920s physics and applied mathematics. By education, I'm an electronics engineer, system engineer and policy analyst. I develope mathematical models and use plenty of algorithms developed by brilliant people to help a stakeholder learn about the future in order to minimize free energy in the system.

I persuit a career and interesting projects in openSci, soft systems and interplretable artifitial intelligence.
